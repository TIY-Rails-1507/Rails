 If you are a Mac, you can open folders\files in Sublime from the terminal. 

Use:
subl dir_name
subl file_name

If that does not work try:

sudo ln -s /Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /usr/bin/subl



If you are using gemsets, this page is useful: https://rvm.io/gemsets
