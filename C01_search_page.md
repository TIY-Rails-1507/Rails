# Add a search page


The objective of this challenge is to create a search page. 

Assuming you have reached '15 queries' then you have covered almost every topic that you need in order to achieve this.

The one topic that we have not covered is query strings, you may need to google that.

You don't need to use query strings, but it is common to use that approach when searching. 


Good luck!



Hints: 

Advanced use of where - http://stackoverflow.com/a/22596992/259477

`form_tag` lets you create a form  without needing a model, this is different to `form_for` which needs a model.

Lookup `form_tag` here http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html
