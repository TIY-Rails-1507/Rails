## Installing Rails

Install Ruby (we have already done this)

Check your version number:

```
mac:dev daryn$ ruby -v
ruby 2.2.2p95 (2015-04-13 revision 50295) [x86_64-darwin14]
mac:dev daryn$ 

```
If you are using RVM, you may choose to create a gemset - this is optional...

To install rails use: 

```
gem install rails --no-ri --no-rdoc
```
Verify that it has worked using:
```
rails -v
```
