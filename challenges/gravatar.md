# Gravatar

## Step 1

Use the Gravatar service to show an avatar on the users profile page.


## Step 2

Create a users index page which shows all of the current users with their Gravatar avatars

Notes: 
* Unlike other services this is usually done in a helper
* You don't need to use a gem, this can be done from scratch
* Don't use a gem
