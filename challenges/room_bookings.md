# Room Bookings

Show a quote for a room booking for a hotel. 

A user can choose a room from a hotel and then choose how many nights they would like to stay. The quote should state the total cost of the stay.

The application should save this quote so that a user can review it later.

Don't worry about letting the user choose dates. You can if you want to but there is quite a bit of work to do without actual dates.
