# Wine Online

Create a new application that let's people 'buy' wine. 

They should be able to buy different quantities of different wine e.g.

Shiraz * 2
Bordeaux * 5


Each bottle has a price and the grand total is shown.


Don't forget the 15% VAT...



### It does not need to be wine

Any product would be fine, provided that you can purchase more than one - so mp3s and ebooks would not be a good choice.

If you don't want to start a new Rails app you can add this to Explore, just come up with a product that can be sold. e.g. a mug.
