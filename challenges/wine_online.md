# Wine Online

Create a new application that let's people get a quote for buying wine. We won't take payments just show the total price.

They should be able to select different wines and different quantities e.g.

Shiraz * 2 
Bordeaux * 5

Each bottle has a price and the grand total is shown.

Don't forget the 15% VAT...


### Any product will do

It does not need to be wine

Any product would be fine, provided that you can purchase more than one - so mp3s and ebooks would not be a good choice.

### Any site will do

If you don't want to start a new Rails app you can add this to Explore, just come up with a product that can be sold. e.g. mugs, travel brochures, concert tickets, plane tickets, hotel rooms (the quantity can be the number of nights).
